- topic: Scalable Distributed Systems
  id: crdt
  sta: current
  description: Developing highly scalable distributed systems, in particular partitioned and geo-replicated database systems. Due to the limitation described by CAP theorem, geo-replicated systems are nowadays moving towards eventual consistency. With no or less synchronisation such systems are able to provide high availability and scalability. I am interested in enabling stronger semantics in such systems without compromising scalability; using CRDTs, transactions and weak consistency semantics such as eventual consistency and causal consistency.
- topic: Concurrent Programming
  id: stm
  sta: current
  description: Developing programming models and techniques for scalable multicore programming. Currently I am studying the applicability of weak consistency in the context of shared memory concurrent programs and Software Transactional Memory (STM). The work aims to provide a programming model based on STM that provides weaker but well defined consistency semantics that enables programmers to write efficient concurrent programs with less effort.
