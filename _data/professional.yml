- org:  Software Technology Group, TU Kaiserslautern
  role: Research Associate
  location: Kaiserslautern, Germany
  when: Feb 2014 - Now
  bullets:
    - Research on scalable protocols for large scale distributed systems and multi-core programs.
    - Collaborated on 2 EU projects, [SyncFree](http://syncfree.lip6.fr/) and [LightKone](https://www.lightkone.eu/).
    - Co-developed [AntidoteDB](http://antidotedb.org), a scalable and highly available geo-replicated database that 
      supports [CRDTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type).
      AntidoteDB is now used by our academic and industrial research partners.
    - Co-designed Cure, the decentralized algorithm implemented in AntidoteDB that
      provides causal consistency and highly available transactions in a geo-replicated
      systems with large number of servers.
    - Developed a model for highly scalable concurrent objects to scale multi-core
      programs by reducing the synchronization needed.
    - Developed a scalable software transactional memory algorithm for multi-core programs.
