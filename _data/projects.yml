    SyncFree is a European research project. Large-scale on-line services including social 
    networks and multiplayer games handle huge quantities of frequently changing shared 
    data. Maintaining its consistency is relatively simple in a centralised cloud, but 
    no longer possible due to increased scalability requirements. Instead, data must 
    replicated across several distributed data centres, requiring new principled approaches 
    to consistency that will be explored by the SyncFree project. Antidote (the reference 
    platform) is a scalable key-value store for synchronisation free computations 
    using CRDTs and causal consistent transaction.

    Adding different authentication mechanisms to a portal interface that we have built for 
    grid access. The portal uses a robot certificate to allow users to run pre-configuration 
    applications on the grid. A single sign-on system using SimpleSAMLPHP was also developed.

    Making semantic interpretation of CRL2 PowerPC assembler code constructs in terms of 
    ALF code and data structures used for Worst Case Execution Time analysis of programs 
    and built a system to extract information from the CRL2 PowerPC code representation 
    and convert it to ALF.
