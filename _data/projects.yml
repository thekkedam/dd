  date: "Jan 2017 - Now"
  description: |
    The goal of LightKone is to develop a scientifically sound and industrially validated 
    model for doing general-purpose computation on edge networks. An edge network consists 
    of a large set of heterogeneous, loosely coupled computing nodes situated at the 
    logical extreme of a network. Common examples are community networks and Internet of 
    Things networks, and networks including mobile devices, personal computers, and 
    points of presence including Mobile Edge Computing. Internet applications are 
    increasingly running on edge networks, to reduce latency, increase scalability, 
    resilience, and security, and permit local decision making.

    SyncFree is a European research project. Large-scale on-line services including social
    networks and multiplayer games handle huge quantities of frequently changing shared
    data. Maintaining its consistency is relatively simple in a centralised cloud, but
    no longer possible due to increased scalability requirements. Instead, data must
    replicated across several distributed data centres, requiring new principled approaches
    to consistency that will be explored by the SyncFree project.
    <a href="http://antidotedb.org" class="link-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AntidoteDB</a> (the reference
    platform) is a scalable key-value store for synchronisation free computations
    using CRDTs and causal consistent transaction.

  description: |
    Due to the dramatic price drop of memory network devices are configured with much larger buffer sizes
    than before in order to prevent packet drop. This undermines the assumptions of the TCP congestion
    avoidance algorithm which depends on packet loss in order to detect and prevent network congestion. We
    investigate the effects of this buffer bloat phenomenon on throughput and latency. Our simulations show
    that increasing buffer sizes reduces throughput slightly, but sharply increases latency. When the link is
    saturated then large buffer sizes cause dramatic reduction of throughput rates for applications which
    transmit data only periodically. In addition we show that TCP is in fact remarkably resilient to packet
    drop and can tolerate very small buffer sizes very well at the benefit of optimal latency.

    Real Time systems are systems which must give accurate results within a precise time period. 
    These systems have now become an indispensable aspect of
    our day to day lives. As the importance of real time system increases, the need to
    ensure safety increases.
    Imagine an intelligent sentry android with decision making ability which
    guards a frontier. It has to make quick analysis of images in order to decide
    whether it has to shoot, warn or say howdy partner. In such cases, it is desirable
    to make a correct calculation (to identify friends and foes) and also to make a
    correct timely behaviour after analysing data from its sensors. This is done by the
    inbuilt software of the android. There lies the risk of the sentry robot not matching
    the image within a given time and failing in functionality. For safety reasons, in
    such real time applications, where meeting deadlines is critical, it is sought-after to
    obtain the worst case execution time of programs.
    Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis finds the upper bound on the
    execution time of a program. By obtaining this, we can design a system which
    works fine even in the most stressed state. SWEdish Execution time Tool
    (SWEET) is a tool for WCET analysis developed by the Mälardalen WCET
    research group. SWEET performs static analyses on an intermediate code format
    named ALF (Artist2 Language for WCET flow Analysis) and finds an upper bound
    of the worst case execution time. aiT is another WCET tool developed by AbsInt
    company for static analysis in real time system. They maintain a format known as
    CRL (Control flow Representation Language) to represent various types of object
    code formats in terms of control flow graphs.
    The main objective of this thesis work is to write a translator from
    CRL2's representation of PowerPC assembler code to ALF.
