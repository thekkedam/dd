  description: |
    SyncFree is a European research project. Large-scale on-line services including social 
    networks and multiplayer games handle huge quantities of frequently changing shared 
    data. Maintaining its consistency is relatively simple in a centralised cloud, but 
    no longer possible due to increased scalability requirements. Instead, data must 
    replicated across several distributed data centres, requiring new principled approaches 
    to consistency that will be explored by the SyncFree project. 
    Antidote (the reference 
    platform) is a scalable key-value store for synchronisation free computations 
    using CRDTs and causal consistent transaction.

  description: |
    Due to the dramatic price drop of memory network devices are configured with much larger buffer sizes
    than before in order to prevent packet drop. This undermines the assumptions of the TCP congestion
    avoidance algorithm which depends on packet loss in order to detect and prevent network congestion. We
    investigate the effects of this buffer bloat phenomenon on throughput and latency. Our simulations show
    that increasing buffer sizes reduces throughput slightly, but sharply increases latency. When the link is
    saturated then large buffer sizes cause dramatic reduction of throughput rates for applications which
    transmit data only periodically. In addition we show that TCP is in fact remarkably resilient to packet
    drop and can tolerate very small buffer sizes very well at the benefit of optimal latency.
