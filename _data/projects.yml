  name_long: "Lightweight computation for networks at the edge"
  id: "lightkone"

  date: "Jan 2017 - Now"
  description: |
    The goal of LightKone is to develop a scientifically sound and industrially validated 
    model for doing general-purpose computation on edge networks. An edge network consists 
    of a large set of heterogeneous, loosely coupled computing nodes situated at the 
    logical extreme of a network. Common examples are community networks and Internet of 
    Things networks, and networks including mobile devices, personal computers, and 
    points of presence including Mobile Edge Computing. Internet applications are 
    increasingly running on edge networks, to reduce latency, increase scalability, 
    resilience, and security, and permit local decision making.

  description: |
    SyncFree is a European research project. Large-scale on-line services including social
    networks and multiplayer games handle huge quantities of frequently changing shared
    data. Maintaining its consistency is relatively simple in a centralised cloud, but
    no longer possible due to increased scalability requirements. Instead, data must
    replicated across several distributed data centres, requiring new principled approaches
    to consistency that will be explored by the SyncFree project.
    [Antidote](http://antidotedb.org) (the reference
    platform) is a scalable key-value store for synchronisation free computations
    using CRDTs and causal consistent transaction.

    Adding different authentication mechanisms to a portal interface for
    grid access. The portal uses a robot certificate to allow users to run pre-configuration
    applications on the grid. A single sign-on system using SimpleSAMLPHP was also developed.

  description: |
    Due to the dramatic price drop of memory network devices are configured with much larger buffer sizes
    than before in order to prevent packet drop. This undermines the assumptions of the TCP congestion
    avoidance algorithm which depends on packet loss in order to detect and prevent network congestion. We
    investigate the effects of this buffer bloat phenomenon on throughput and latency. Our simulations show
    that increasing buffer sizes reduces throughput slightly, but sharply increases latency. When the link is
    saturated then large buffer sizes cause dramatic reduction of throughput rates for applications which
    transmit data only periodically. In addition we show that TCP is in fact remarkably resilient to packet
    drop and can tolerate very small buffer sizes very well at the benefit of optimal latency.
