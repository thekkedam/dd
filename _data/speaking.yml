  description: 'In distributed Erlang systems temporary network issues are very likely; and can affect the consistency of the system. If the system is a distributed data store relying on a weak consistency model, its data stored may diverge as a result of connectivity issues. Even worse, there is no indicator of the divergence. In this paper we present our initial work on divergence metrics and give a preliminary evaluation on exposing divergence to the system operator.'
