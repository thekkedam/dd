	<p>Hi, I am <span itemprop="name">Deepthi Devaki Akkoorath</span> <br> and I am a <span itemprop="title">PhD student</span> in the <a href="https://softech.informatik.uni-kl.de/">Software Technology Group</a> at <a href="http://www.uni-kl.de/">TU Kaiserslautern</a>, supervised by <a href="https://softech.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/de/staff/AnnetteBieniusa/">Dr. rer. nat. Annette Bieniusa</a> and <a href="https://softech.cs.uni-kl.de/homepage/de/staff/PoetzschHeffter/">Prof. Dr. Arnd Poetzsch-Heffter</a>.</p>
	<p>My research is on weak memory consistency in concurrent and distributed systems. Currently I am working on SyncFree project <a href="/projects/#syncfree">Antidote</a>. I am also interested in the semantics and applicability of weak/eventual consistency in the context of shared memory concurrent programs and Software Transactional Memory (STM).</p>
