Problem

Application built on EC databases may tolerate some divergence.
But large divergence may result in SLA violations or
unsatisfactory client experiences.
How to quantify divergence?
How to monitor divergence?

Divergence
Measure of how different the state of a replica compared to
others
Number of missing updates
Require information about all updates in other replicas
Not practical to measure

Staleness

How old is the data?
≈ Time elapsed from last synchronisation
Only potential staleness

Measuring Staleness in Antidote
Consistency protocol: Cure
Based on timestamps from real clocks such as NTP
Maintains a vector of timestamps
Eg:- [{dc1 , 10}, {dc2 , 11}]
Received all updates with timestamps ≤ 10 from dc1
Received all updates with timestamp ≤ 11 from dc2

Received all updates with timestamp ≤ 11 from dc2

Staleness = difference between local timestamp and the
observed

Measuring Staleness in Antidote

An erlang process running in each node
Periodically probes vector clock and calculates staleness
Store result in Exometer histogram
Exometer - package for instrumenting Erlang code

Monitoring Divergence
WombatOAM plugin for antidote
Read metrics stored in Exometer
Communicates to Wombat

WombatOAM
Configure threshold values
Exposes the maximum and median values
Raise alarms when divergence exceeds the threshold
