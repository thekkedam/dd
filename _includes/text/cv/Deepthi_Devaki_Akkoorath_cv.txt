Technical University of Kaiserslautern, Germany.
Feb 2014-Now
Research on scalable synchronization-free protocols for large-scale
distributed systems and multi-core concurrent programs.
• Co-developed AntidoteDB, a scalable and highly available
geo-replicated database. AntidoteDB is now used by our academic and
industrial research partners.
• Co-designed Cure, the decentralized algorithm implemented in
AntidoteDB that provides causal consistency and highly available
transactions in a geo-replicated systems with large number of servers.
• Developed techniques for scalable concurrent objects for fast
multi-threaded programs.
• Mentored several master thesis, student seminars and projects.
• Gave talks, tutorials and demos and guided new developers on
AntidoteDB.
